Tetris in Javascript
====================

This was a brief project where I had to build a Tetris game in Javascript. Tetrominoes fall from the top of the screen in random columns, and the player's task is to arrange them so that they form complete rows.

Instructions
------------

Use the left and right arrows to move the falling Tetromino left and right, and use the A and D keys to rotate clockwise/counterclockwise.

When a row is filled, it will disappear and the 'Rows Cleared' score will update.

When the pieces hit the top of the game area, an alert will pop up allowing the player to play again. If the player chooses to play again, the game board will reset. Otherwise, the board will remain visible in its lost state.
